* Implement core arithmetic operations for addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulo, and exponentiation.
* Demonstrate C# practices including nullable reference handling, error management, and code organization.
* Keep arithmetic operations in testable public methods.
* Provide xUnit tests with both fact and theory test approaches.
* Enable a clean, interactive console experience with clear user feedback.
* Maintain a solution structure with separate application and test projects.

## 1.5 Scope

* Add error handling and screen clearing.
* Make methods public for test access.

## 1.12 Implementation Guidance

### 1.12.1 Solution Setup

Create a PowerShell script named `Set-DotnetSlnForCalculator.ps1` in `$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)\src\workspace` that performs these actions:

* Creates a solution folder named `calculator-xunit-testing`.
* Sets up a new solution using `dotnet new sln`.
* Adds a console application project named `calculator` using `dotnet new console`.
* Adds an xUnit test project named `calculator.tests` using `dotnet new xunit`.
* Configures project references between the projects.
* Changes default file names from `Program.cs` to `Calculator.cs` and from `UnitTest1.cs` to `CalculatorTest.cs`.
* Targets .NET 8 in both projects.
* Builds the solution to verify setup.
* Executes the PowerShell script to create the solution structure.

Implementation notes:

* Use the standard `dotnet new` templates and ensure both project files target `net8.0`.
* The setup script can pass `--framework net8.0` when creating supported project templates.
* Keep the solution under `src/workspace/calculator-xunit-testing`.

### 1.12.2 Calculator Implementation

The active solution uses this file structure:

| File                                 | Purpose                                                              |
|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `calculator/Calculator.cs`           | Top-level console interaction, prompting, looping, and user feedback |
| `calculator/CalculatorOperations.cs` | Public static arithmetic methods used by the console app and tests   |
| `calculator.tests/CalculatorTest.cs` | xUnit tests for arithmetic operations and divide-by-zero cases       |

Implementation requirements:

* Define public static methods for arithmetic operations in `CalculatorOperations.cs`.
* Keep top-level console statements in `Calculator.cs`.
* Prompt for the first operand, second operand, and operator.
* Perform the appropriate arithmetic operation.
* Display the result or a friendly error message.
* Ask whether the user wants to perform another calculation.
* Handle user responses to continue or exit.
* Use nullable-aware input handling for console input.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Top-level statements and class or namespace declarations cannot be mixed in the same C# source file in invalid order. Keep reusable operation methods in `CalculatorOperations.cs` and the console workflow in `Calculator.cs`.

### 1.12.3 Refactoring Steps

* Convert arithmetic operations into methods for testability.
* Make methods public so the xUnit project can test them.
* Add screen clearing for a better user experience.
* Implement modulo and exponent operations.
* Add null handling to prevent input-related exceptions.

### 1.12.4 Testing Strategy

* Create xUnit tests for each calculator operation.
* Use `[Fact]` tests for single-scenario assertions.
* Use `[Theory]` tests with `[InlineData]` for multiple cases.
* Include edge cases such as division by zero and modulo by zero.
* Ensure all tests pass before completion.

## 1.13 Cleanup Solution

Use the `reset-calculator-lab` skill and its bundled
`.github/skills/reset-calculator-lab/scripts/Remove-DotnetSlnForCalculator.ps1`
script to perform these actions:

* Gets the repository root path using `git rev-parse --show-toplevel`.
* Constructs the workspace path as `{RepoRoot}\src\workspace`.
* Identifies the solution directory as `{Workspace}\calculator-xunit-testing`.
* Requires the existing `{RepoRoot}\src\completed` folder to be empty.
* Supports a `-WhatIf` preview and explicit confirmation.
* Copies the solution to `{RepoRoot}\src\completed\calculator-xunit-testing`.
* Verifies the preserved directory before removing the workspace copy.
* Blocks removal when preservation prerequisites are not satisfied.
* Provides status messages for successful removal, safe failures, and no-op runs.

Execution from the repository root:

```powershell
pwsh .github/skills/reset-calculator-lab/scripts/Remove-DotnetSlnForCalculator.ps1 -WhatIf
pwsh .github/skills/reset-calculator-lab/scripts/Remove-DotnetSlnForCalculator.ps1 -Confirm
```

The script preserves the completed solution before removing the generated
workspace, allowing the exercise to be reset without discarding the final
implementation.

## 1.14 Additional Learning Outcomes

* Understanding .NET solution and project structure
* Working with C# top-level statements
* Understanding C# source file structure constraints
* Implementing nullable-aware input handling in C#
* Writing xUnit tests with facts and theories
* Creating reusable setup and cleanup scripts
* Managing package versions for .NET projects

## 1.15 Troubleshooting Guide

### 1.15.1 Build Error CS8803: Top-Level Statements Must Precede Declarations

Cause: Top-level statements and class declarations are in the same file or ordered incorrectly.

Solution: Keep console workflow code in `Calculator.cs` and reusable operation methods in `CalculatorOperations.cs`.

### 1.15.2 Unexpected Test Discovery Count

Cause: The test project may have incompatible package versions, stale build output, or corrupted test files.

Solution: Verify package versions in `calculator.tests.csproj`, run `dotnet clean`, restore packages, and rerun the tests.

### 1.15.3 Target Framework Mismatch

Cause: Project files target a framework other than `net8.0`.

Solution: Verify `calculator.csproj` and `calculator.tests.csproj` both contain `<TargetFramework>net8.0</TargetFramework>`.

### 1.15.4 Test File Corrupted Or Reverted

Cause: Previous failed operations may have reverted `CalculatorTest.cs` to a stub implementation.

Solution: Reapply the testing strategy and verify tests cover all public arithmetic methods.

### 1.15.5 Build Succeeds But Tests Do Not Run

Cause: Build artifacts may be stale after framework or package changes.

Solution: Run `dotnet clean`, `dotnet restore`, and `dotnet build` before running tests again.

### 1.15.6 Setup Script Creates Projects Targeting The Wrong Framework

Cause: The `dotnet new` command may use the installed SDK default if no framework is specified.

Solution: Pass `--framework net8.0` where supported, or programmatically replace the `<TargetFramework>` value in both project files after project creation.
