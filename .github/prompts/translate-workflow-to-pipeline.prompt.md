# Translate Workflow To Pipeline

## Context

To simplify the migration from GitHub Actions to Azure DevOps Pipelines, we need to convert existing GitHub workflow files into Azure DevOps pipeline YAML files.

## Intent

As a developer responsible for maintaining CI/CD processes, I want to automate the translation of GitHub workflow files into Azure DevOps pipeline YAML files. This will help streamline our migration process and ensure consistency between the two systems.

## Specific Request

Translate the basic workflow at: "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)\.github\workflows\01-level-workflow.yml" to an equivalent azure devops pipeline YAML and save it in the directory "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)\.azure-pipelines\01-level-pipeline.yml".

## Guidelines

- Ensure that all GitHub Actions-specific syntax and features are appropriately mapped to their Azure DevOps counterparts.
- Maintain the logical structure and flow of the original workflow in the translated pipeline.
- Validate the generated Azure DevOps pipeline YAML for correctness and completeness.
- If there are any features in the GitHub workflow that do not have a direct equivalent in Azure DevOps, provide a comment in the generated YAML indicating this.
- Preserve any environment variables, secrets, and other configurations as much as possible.
- If the `01-level-pipeline.yml` file already exists, overwrite it with the new translation.
- Create a new Azure DevOps project in the organization `autocloudarc-mcaps` with the project name ranslate-workflow-to-pipeline` and set its visibility to private. If the project already exists, skip the creation step.
- Manual step: Reference the personal access token stored in the GitHub PAT `jet-brains-ide-generic-pat-classic` for authentication when importing the repository.

## Caveats

- Some GitHub Actions may not have direct equivalents in Azure DevOps. In these cases, provide alternative solutions or workarounds.
- Ensure that any third-party actions used in the GitHub workflow are either replaced with native Azure DevOps tasks or documented for manual implementation.
- Pay attention to differences in syntax, especially for conditionals, loops, and job dependencies.
- When displaying the default branch in Azure DevOps pipelines, do not attempt to display the default branch, since Azure DevOps would require fetching it via the Azure DevOps REST API or setting it as a pipeline variable manually beforehand, which is outside the scope of this simple translation task.

## Implementation Steps

### Create Azure DevOps Project

- Use the Azure DevOps CLI or REST API to create a new project named ranslate-workflow-to-pipeline`.
- Configure the project with the private visibility setting.
- Ensure the project is ready to accept pipeline definitions.

### Validate Project Creation

- Confirm the project exists and is accessible.
- Retrieve the project ID for subsequent pipeline operations.

### Translate and Deploy Pipeline

- Read the GitHub Actions workflow file from the specified path.
- Convert all workflow steps, jobs, and triggers to Azure DevOps pipeline syntax.
- Create the Azure DevOps pipeline YAML in the `.azure-pipelines` directory.
- Push the pipeline definition to the newly created project.

### Verify Pipeline Configuration

- Validate the generated pipeline YAML syntax.
- Confirm all variables, secrets, and dependencies are properly configured.
- Test pipeline creation in the Azure DevOps project.

## Tools Required

- `azuredevops/project/create` - Create the Azure DevOps project
- `azuredevops/pipeline/create` - Create the pipeline from YAML
- `github/file/read` - Read the source GitHub Actions workflow
- `github/file/write` - Write the translated pipeline to repository

## Success Criteria

- Azure DevOps project ranslate-workflow-to-pipeline` is successfully created.
- Pipeline YAML is translated and saved to `.azure-pipelines/01-level-pipeline.yml`.
- Pipeline is registered in the Azure DevOps project and ready for execution.
