Purpose:
- Review Markdown files for formatting, accessibility, and style consistency.
- Apply fixes that follow GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM) and CommonMark recommendations.
- Produce a short edit summary and optionally apply safe, mechanical changes.

When To Use:
- Before merging README/PRD/CONTRIBUTING/CHANGELOG/guide docs.
- When a PR contains Markdown files that must pass lint rules.
- For automated pre-commit or CI documentation checks.

Inputs:
- Path(s) to Markdown file(s) to check (relative to repository root)
- Optional: preferred ruleset (`github`, `commonmark`, or `custom`).
- Optional: whether to auto-apply safe fixes (`yes|no`).

Outputs:
- Lint report: list of issues (file, line, rule-id, brief guidance).
- Suggested patch (unified diff) for safe automated fixes.
- A short reasoning summary for any manual edits recommended.

Tools (recommended) and install commands:
- `markdownlint-cli` (npm)
  - Install: `npm install -g markdownlint-cli`
  - Run: `markdownlint -c .markdownlint.json \"**/*.md\"`
- `prettier` for formatting
  - Install: `npm install -g prettier`
  - Run: `prettier --check \"**/*.md\"`
- `proselint` (optional stylistic checks)
  - Install: `pip install proselint`
  - Run: `proselint file.md`

Primary Behavior & Constraints:
- Prefer mechanical, reversible edits (whitespace, fence blank lines, list spacing, code-fence languages, relative links, trailing newline).
- Do not alter factual content, code snippets, command examples, or license text without explicit confirmation.
- For ambiguous or non-mechanical edits, produce a recommended change and ask for confirmation.
- All auto-applied edits must be idempotent and safe to run multiple times.

Core Rules & Mappings (based on GitHub / CommonMark / markdownlint)
- Headings:
  - Use ATX style `# Heading` (GFM). No duplicate top-level titles within a doc. (MD024)
  - One blank line before and after headings where appropriate. (MD032)
- Fenced Code Blocks:
  - Always use fenced code blocks with language where applicable: ```pwsh, ```bash, ```json, ```yaml. (MD040)
  - Ensure blank lines surround fenced code blocks. (MD031)
- Lists:
  - One blank line before a list and after the list. Use consistent list marker (`-` or `*`) across repo. (MD032, MD004)
- Links & Images:
  - Use descriptive link text. Prefer relative links for repo files, absolute links only for external resources.
  - Provide `alt` text for images and avoid broken links. (MD034)
- Line Length:
  - Prefer hard wrap at 80-100 chars for paragraphs; allow long lines in code blocks and tables. (MD013)
- Emphasis & Inline Code:
  - Use backticks for inline code and avoid mixing emphasis markers inconsistently. (MD022)
- Trailing Newline:
  - Files must end with a single newline. (MD047)
- Blank lines & Fenced fences:
  - Do not place lists/code fences without surrounding blank lines. (MD031, MD032)
- Tables:
  - Use pipe tables with alignment if used. Keep simple and avoid wide tables when possible.
- Accessibility:
  - Provide readable alt attributes for images.
  - Use clear headings hierarchy for screen readers.
- File names & paths:
  - Use `README.md` for root docs, `CONTRIBUTING.md` for contribution guidelines, `SECURITY.md` for security policy, and preserve case for linking on case-sensitive systems.
- YAML front matter:
  - Keep front matter minimal and ensure closing fence (---) present.

Suggested Rule-set (example `.markdownlint.json` minimal):
{
  "default": true,
  "MD013": false,
  "MD033": false,
  "MD044": false
}

Agent Workflow (what the agent does step-by-step):
1. Validate input paths exist. If not, return an error with suggestions.
2. Run `markdownlint` with the repo ruleset and collect diagnostics.
3. Run `prettier --check` to detect formatting differences for Markdown.
4. Build a prioritized list of issues:
   - Auto-fixable (whitespace, blank lines, fence languages, trailing newline)
   - Needs review (content changes, link rewrites, image alt text)
5. If `auto-apply=yes`:
   - Apply safe changes:
     - Ensure trailing newline
     - Surround code fences with blank lines
     - Ensure code fence language tokens exist when language is detected
     - Add blank lines around lists/blocks
     - Normalize heading ATX spacing (single space after `#`)
     - Convert absolute repo-local file paths to relative paths where unambiguous
   - Re-run linters and provide resulting diff.
6. For non-mechanical edits:
   - Produce a suggested patch and explain rationale line-by-line; request confirmation.
7. Produce final report: summary, files changed, linter results, suggested PR description.

Patch Application Example:
- Use `git apply --index` for applying diffs in local workflows.
- Always show a unified diff before applying changes and ask for consent when run interactively.

Progress & Interaction:
- The agent reports progress after each major step: (a) lint run, (b) auto-fixes applied, (c) suggested patches produced.
- For interactive sessions ask concise questions, e.g., “Apply 7 safe edits to `README.md`? (yes/no)”.

Examples of safe edits (before → after):
- Ensure fenced code block language:
  ```diff
  - ```
  + ```pwsh
- Add trailing newline:
  (missing) → (a single newline at EOF)
- Surround code fences with blank lines:
  (no blank line) → (blank line before and after fence)

Edge Cases & What the agent will not change:
- Do not rewrite prose for tone/meaning (use suggestions instead).
- Do not alter legal/licensing sections without explicit confirmation.
- Avoid changing long-form markdown tables that may be render-sensitive without review.

Security & Privacy:
- The agent does not send file contents to external services by default.
- If external lint services are used, obtain explicit permission and document the service.

Exit conditions:
- Return success when all files pass lint rules or after user-approved fixes are applied.
- Return non-zero status when critical errors remain or user canceled interactive steps.

Usage examples (PowerShell):
```pwsh
# Check files
markdownlint -c .markdownlint.json [README.md](http://_vscodecontentref_/0)

# Auto-fix mechanical issues (example using a script)
# This agent recommends diffs; use git to apply after review
markdownlint -f -c .markdownlint.json [README.md](http://_vscodecontentref_/1)
prettier --write [README.md](http://_vscodecontentref_/2)
