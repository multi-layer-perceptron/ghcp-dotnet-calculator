# GitHub Copilot Instructions

Purpose

This file provides custom instructions for using GitHub Copilot in this repository. It helps ensure that both human contributors and AI-generated code adhere to our project's standards, coding practices, and overall quality requirements.

General Guidelines [Vibe Coding](https://youtu.be/YWwS911iLhg?si=TEdJIIqGryZdjezy)

Always prefer simple solutions.

Avoid duplication of code whenever possible, which means checking for other areas of the codebase that might already have similar code and functionality.

Write code that takes into account the different environments, for example; dev, test, and prod.

<!-- - Only make changes that are requested unless you are confident, the context is well understood and related to the change being requested. -->

<!-- When fixing an issue or bug, do not introduce a new pattern or technology without first exhausting all options for the existing implementation. If however, you must still introduce a new pattern, make sure to please remove the old implementation afterwards so we don't have duplicate logic. -->

Keep the codebase clean and organized

Avoid writing scripts in files if possible, especially if the script is likely only to be executed once.

Avoid having files over 100-200 lines of code; Instead please refactor if the logic approaches 200 lines.

Mocking data is only needed for tests, never mock data for dev or prod.

Never add stubbing or fake data patterns to code that affects the dev or prod environments.

Never overwrite the .env file without consent.

<!--  -->

Coding workflow preferences: [Vibe Coding](https://youtu.be/YWwS911iLhg?si=TEdJIIqGryZdjezy)

Focus on the areas of code relevant to the task.

Do not touch code that is unrelated to the task.

Write through tests for all major functionality.

Avoid making major changes to the patterns and architecture of how a feature works, after it has been proven to work properly, unless explicitly prompted to do so.

Always consider how changes and updates may negatively impact the current function of the solution.

Project specific custom instructions

Template for Project Specific Instructions

When crafting a custom instruction set for a specific project, reference the following content as a template to ensure all necessary aspects are covered: [Project Specific Instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/concepts/prompting/response-customization?tool=vscode#writing-effective-custom-instructions-1 "Project or folder level custom instructions").

Example Instruction Files

[Custom Instructions](https://github.com/github/awesome-copilot/tree/main/instructions "Examples")

Code Style

**General:** Follow the repository's style guide for consistency.

**Naming Conventions:** Use meaningful and descriptive names.

For JavaScript/TypeScript, use camelCase for variables and functions.

For Python, adhere to [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).

**Line Length:** Aim for 80-100 characters per line where possible.

**Formatting:** Use automated tools (like Prettier or Black) to enforce formatting rules.

SQL

General SQL Guidelines

Reference both Microsoft T-SQL as well as PostgreSQL syntax where applicable

Use appropriate SQL dialect based on the target database system

Follow database-specific best practices for performance and security

Always use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection

SQLite

**Executable:** Use `sqlite3` for executing SQLite commands and scripts

**File-based:** SQLite databases are file-based (`.db`, `.sqlite`, `.sqlite3` extensions)

**Lightweight:** Ideal for local development, testing, and embedded applications

SQLite Usage Examples

## Connect to database and run a query

```pwsh

Open database file

sqlite3 database.db "SELECT * FROM tablename;"

Interactive mode

sqlite3 database.db

```text

## Common SQLite commands

```text
sql

.help                 -- Show help

.tables               -- List all tables

.schema tablename     -- Show table schema

.mode column          -- Set output mode

.headers on           -- Show column headers

.quit                 -- Exit sqlite3

```text

## Run script file

```text
pwsh

sqlite3 database.db < script.sql

```text
Microsoft SQL Server / Azure SQL

**Executable:** Use `sqlcmd` for executing T-SQL commands and scripts

**Modern sqlcmd (Go-based):** Cross-platform, recommended for new projects

**Legacy sqlcmd.exe (ODBC-based):** Traditional Windows tool

**Bulk Operations:** Use `bcp` (Bulk Copy Program) for bulk data import/export

**Database Connectivity:** Ensure proper connection strings and authentication methods are used

Connecting to SQL Server / Azure SQL

When a connection to a database is requested in a prompt, use the sqlcmd tool with appropriate parameters for server, database, authentication, and query execution.

sqlcmd Usage Examples

## Connect and run a query

```text
pwsh

Modern sqlcmd or legacy sqlcmd.exe

sqlcmd -S <server>.database.windows.net -d <database> -U <username> -P <password> -Q "SELECT * FROM sys.tables"

```text

## Run a script file

```text
pwsh

sqlcmd -S <server>.database.windows.net -d <database> -U <username> -i script.sql -o output.txt

```text

## Interactive session

```text
pwsh

Start interactive session

sqlcmd -S <server> -d <database> -U <username> -P <password>

Inside sqlcmd, type GO after each query to execute

Type EXIT to quit

```text
Authentication Options

`-U` and `-P`: SQL Authentication

`-E`: Windows/Integrated Authentication

`-G`: Azure Active Directory Authentication

`-G -P`: Azure AD with password

Related Tools

**Azure Data Studio** (`azuredatastudio`) - GUI with integrated terminal

**SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)** - Windows GUI tool

**mssql-cli** - Interactive command-line with IntelliSense

SQL Best Practices

Use transactions for data integrity

Always verify with SELECT before UPDATE or DELETE operations

Include WHERE clauses to prevent accidental mass updates/deletes

Use appropriate indexes for query performance

Document complex queries with comments

Use consistent formatting and naming conventions

Test queries in development before running in production

Commenting

**Clarity:** Write clear and concise comments for complex logic.

**Inline Comments:** Use sparingly to explain non-obvious code segments.

**Documentation:** Document functions, methods, and classes using appropriate docstring formats (e.g., JSDoc, Python docstrings).

Testing Guidelines

**General Rule:** Write tests alongside new features and bug fixes.

## Frameworks

**.NET:** Use the xUnit framework.

**Java:** Use JUnit.

**TypeScript:** Prefer Vitest.

**Python:** Use pytest.

**Go:** Use Testify.

**Node.js:** Use Jest.

**C:** Use Unity.

**C++:** Use Google Test.

**Coverage:** Ensure critical paths and edge cases are covered.

Documentation

**README:** Keep the README.md updated with usage instructions and examples.

**API Docs:** Maintain inline documentation and generated API docs.

**Style:** Use Markdown for all documentation, ensuring consistency in headings and formatting using the [markdownlint](https://github.com/DavidAnson/markdownlint "Markdown Linting Rules") rules.

**Warnings** Ensure that after each markdown file is created, it is also scanned for and reformated to fix any markdown linting violations.

**Relative Links:** Use relative links for internal documentation references.

**Examples:** Provide code examples where applicable.

**URLs:** Apply the label, URL and title format for all links in markdown files. For example: [GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com "GitHub Documentation")

Commit Messages

**Format:** Use the following pattern:

Topic Subtopic Activity Specification: **_topic(subtopic): activity_**

Example: `github(instructions): expand guideline details`

Do not rely on any other industry best practices. Instead, enforce this format above.

Key Points

**Topic:** Indicates the nature of the commit (e.g., `github` for github specific files, commands, or configuration, `feat` for a new feature, `fix` for a bug fix, `docs` for documentation changes, etc.).

**Subtopic (optional):** An attributive or adjunct noun acting as a modifier or a certain scope for the topic that adds additional context. (e.g., `instructions`, `auth`, `ui`, `build`).

**Activity:** A concise, imperative description of the change.

For example:

feat(auth): add login functionality

This format provides clear context and can be easily parsed by tools. The Topic Subtopic Activity specification aims to provide clarity, flexibility and compatibility with automation tools.

**Clarity:** Keep commit messages clear and descriptive to facilitate easier reviews and history tracking.

Branching Strategy

**Main Branch:** Reserve for production-ready code.

**Feature Branches:** Develop new features in branches named descriptively (e.g., `feature/login-system`).

**Bugfix Branches:** Use names like `bugfix/issue-123` for clarity.

**Merging:** Ensure branches pass all tests and code reviews before merging into main.

Pull Request Process

**Submission:** Open a pull request for every new feature or bugfix.

**Description:** Provide a detailed description, linking relevant issues if applicable.

**CI Checks:** Confirm that all automated tests and linters pass if available or applicable.

**Reviews:** Request reviews from at least one other team member before merging.

Continuous Integration / Build Process

**Automation:** Use CI tools to run tests, linters, and build scripts automatically.

**Branch Protection:** Enforce branch protection rules to ensure quality and stability.

**Reporting:** Monitor build status and address any failures promptly.

Security and Error Handling

**Validation:** Always validate inputs and handle errors gracefully.

**Best Practices:** Follow secure coding practices and check for vulnerabilities using automated tools.

**Error Logging:** Implement error logging and monitoring to detect issues early.

Language Specific Instructions

PowerShell

End control structures, loops and functions with `#end if,#end for,#end foreach, #end while,#end until,#end case, #end FunctionName`.

Place each opening bracket '{' on a new line for each scope within a foreach, while, until, for loop or function block. For example:foreach ($item in $contents)

{

    Write-Host "Name: $($item.Name)"

Write-Host "Full Name: $($item.FullName)"

Write-Host "Size: $($item.Length) bytes"

Write-Host "Last Modified: $($item.LastWriteTime)"

Write-Host "-----------------------------"

} # end foreach

Use PascalCase for variables, functions, and classes.

Include comments for any non-trivial logic within scripts.

PowerShell Script Header Template

All PowerShell scripts that do not already contain a header should include comprehensive comment-based help. Use this template as a starting point:

```text
powershell

```text
Virtual Environment Management with venv

**Preference:** Use Python's built-in `venv` module for creating and managing virtual environments. This is the preferred approach over alternatives like `virtualenv`, `conda`, or `pipenv` unless specifically required by the project.

## Setup and Best Practices:# Create a virtual environment

```text
bash

## Create virtual environment in project root

python -m venv dev

## Alternative naming for specific Python versions

python3.11 -m venv dev-3.11

```text

## Activate the virtual environment

```text
bash

## Windows (PowerShell/Command Prompt)

dev\Scripts\activate

## Windows (Git Bash)

source venv/Scripts/activate

## macOS/Linux

source venv/bin/activate

```text

## Verify activation

```text
bash

## Check that pip points to virtual environment

which pip  # macOS/Linux

where pip  # Windows

## Should show path containing your venv directory

pip --version

```text

## Install dependencies

```text
bash

## Upgrade pip first

python -m pip install --upgrade pip

## Install from requirements file

pip install -r requirements.txt

## Install development dependencies

pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

```text

## Generate requirements files

```text
bash

## Generate requirements.txt

pip freeze > requirements.txt

## Better approach: use pipreqs for project-specific dependencies

pip install pipreqs

pipreqs . --force

```text

## Deactivate when done

```text
bash

deactivate

```text

## Directory Structure

```text
text

project-root/

├── venv/                    # Virtual environment (add to .gitignore)

└── README.md               # Include venv setup instructions

```text

## Requirements Files Best Practices

**requirements.txt**: Production dependencies only, pinned versions

```text
text

requests==2.31.0

flask==2.3.3

python-dotenv==1.0.0

```text
**requirements-dev.txt**: Development dependencies, can include requirements.txt

```text
text

-r requirements.txt

pytest==7.4.2

black==23.7.0

flake8==6.0.0

mypy==1.5.1

```text

## VS Code Integration:# Select Python interpreter

Press `Ctrl+Shift+P`

Type "Python: Select Interpreter"

Choose the interpreter from your venv folder

## Workspace settings (.vscode/settings.json)

```text
json
{
  "python.pythonPath": "./venv/Scripts/python.exe",

  "python.terminal.activateEnvironment": true,

  "python.linting.enabled": true,

  "python.linting.pylintEnabled": true,

  "python.formatting.provider": "black"
}

source dev/bin/activate  # macOS/Linux

python -m pip install --upgrade pip

Package management

pip list                          # List installed packages

pip show package_name            # Show package details

pip install package_name==1.0.0  # Install specific version

pip uninstall package_name       # Uninstall package

Requirements management

pip freeze > requirements.txt     # Save current state

pip install -r requirements.txt   # Install from requirements

pip list --outdated              # Check for updates

```text

## Troubleshooting

**Permission errors**: Use `python -m pip` instead of `pip` directly

**Path issues**: Ensure virtual environment is activated before installing packages

**Module not found**: Verify correct interpreter is selected in VS Code

**Stale cache**: Use `pip install --no-cache-dir package_name`

## Environment Variables

Use `.env` files with `python-dotenv` for environment-specific configuration

Never commit `.env` files to version control

Provide `.env.example` with placeholder values

Store sensitive information (API keys, passwords) in environment variables

Java

For Java apps, use maven for build automation, dependency management, project structure standardization, plugins and extensibility and project information management unless otherwise specified in prompts.

C++

Use the recommended project directory structure

Create the project structure using this prompt as a reference:

_Create a python script at relative path: ...programming\cpp\workspace named cpp_project_setup.py that will create C++ a project workspace directory structure and files based on the guidance provided in the 'MyCppProject' example in copilot-instructions.md. Name the project 'cpp-project-name'._

The recommended directory and file structure for a modern, clean, and maintainable **C** project is very similar to the C++ structure, but typically simpler. Here's a well-accepted and standard layout:

---

Recommended Project Structure for C

MyCProject/

├── build/                  # Build output (executables, binaries, object files)

├── docs/                   # Documentation files

├── examples/               # Example usage of your library/application (optional)

├── external/               # Third-party libraries or dependencies (optional)

├── include/                # Public header files (.h files)

│   └── MyCProject/

│       └── foo.h

├── src/                    # Source code files (.c files and private headers)

│   ├── foo.c

│   └── internal/

│       └── helper.h

├── tests/                  # Unit and integration tests

│   └── test_foo.c

├── scripts/                # Utility scripts (build automation, CI/CD, etc.)

├── .gitignore              # Git ignore rules

├── .clang-format           # Formatting rules (optional, but recommended)

├── CMakeLists.txt          # Modern build system (recommended)

├── LICENSE                 # License information

└── README.md               # Project overview and build instructions

---

Explanation of directories and files:

## 1. Root-Level Files

`README.md`: Overview, build instructions, and example usage.

`LICENSE`: Contains open-source license (MIT, Apache, GPL, etc.).

`.gitignore`: Ignore build outputs, binaries, temporary files.

`.clang-format`: Recommended formatting style for consistent code.

`CMakeLists.txt`: Recommended build system (CMake is increasingly common even for C).

**2. `include/`**

Contains public headers (`.h` files) intended for external usage.

Use project name subdirectories (`include/MyCProject`) to avoid name collisions.

**3. `src/`**

Contains all implementation (`.c`) files and internal/private header files.

Private headers (internal implementation details) are typically placed in a subdirectory (e.g., `internal`).

**4. `tests/`**

Contains unit or integration tests.

Typically uses testing frameworks like Unity, CMocka, Criterion, or custom test runners.

**5. `examples/`**

Optional: Contains example programs demonstrating usage of your library/application.

**6. `external/`**

Optional: Includes third-party libraries or code dependencies if not managed by a package manager.

**7. `docs/`**

Documentation and files related to documentation generators (Doxygen, Sphinx, etc.).

**8. `scripts/`**

Build automation scripts, CI/CD scripts, deployment, packaging, etc.

**9. `build/`**

All generated build artifacts (binaries, objects, executables) go here and are never committed to source control.

Minimal Example CMakeLists.txt for C:

cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.16)

project(MyCProject VERSION 1.0 LANGUAGES C)

Set C standard (C11 recommended)

set(CMAKE_C_STANDARD 11)

set(CMAKE_C_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)

Define library

add_library(${PROJECT_NAME} src/foo.c)

target_include_directories(${PROJECT_NAME}

    PUBLIC

        ${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}/include

    PRIVATE

        ${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}/src

)

Example executable

add_executable(${PROJECT_NAME}_example examples/example_main.c)

target_link_libraries(${PROJECT_NAME}_example PRIVATE ${PROJECT_NAME})

Enable tests

enable_testing()

add_subdirectory(tests)

  ---

Best Practices for C Projects:

Clearly separate **public headers** (`include/`) from **implementation details** (`src/`).

Use a modern build system (CMake is widely accepted, alternatives are Makefiles, Meson, Bazel).

Write clear documentation and comments.

Consistently format code with tools like `clang-format`.

Place unit tests in a dedicated directory to encourage good testing practices.

Avoid mixing third-party code directly into your source; use a dedicated `external/` folder or dependency management tools.

---

This recommended structure will help ensure your project remains clear, maintainable, and scalable over time.

PRD Format Outline Example

1. Product Requirements Document (PRD): Workflows and Pipelines

1.1 Document Information

**Version:** 1.0

**Author(s):** GitHub Copilot

**Date:** June 16, 2025

**Status:** Draft

1.2 Executive Summary

This document defines the requirements for a GitHub Actions workflow and Azure DevOps pipeline solution that automates repository content listing, artifact management, and workflow metadata reporting. The solution is designed to demonstrate best practices in CI/CD automation, artifact handling, and cross-platform scripting within a modern DevOps environment.

1.3 Problem Statement

Teams need a reliable, repeatable, and auditable way to list repository contents, manage build artifacts, and report workflow metadata as part of their CI/CD process. Manual steps are error-prone and do not scale for modern DevOps practices.

1.4 Goals and Objectives

Automate repository content listing and artifact management using GitHub Actions and Azure DevOps pipelines.

Provide clear, auditable steps for artifact upload, download, and display.

Enable workflow metadata reporting for traceability.

Support both PowerShell and Python scripting for cross-platform compatibility.

1.5 Scope

1.5.1 In Scope

GitHub Actions workflow and Azure DevOps pipeline YAML definitions

Steps for listing repository contents using PowerShell and Python

Artifact upload and download

Workflow metadata reporting (branch, event, job ID)

Manual and event-based workflow triggers

1.5.2 Out of Scope

Deployment to production environments

Integration with external systems beyond GitHub and Azure DevOps

Advanced artifact retention or security policies

1.6 User Stories / Use Cases

As a DevOps engineer, I want to list all repository contents and save the results as artifacts for auditing.

As a developer, I want to trigger workflows manually or on demand from the main branch.

As a team lead, I want to view workflow metadata (branch, event, job ID) for traceability.

As a user, I want to download and inspect artifacts generated by previous jobs.

1.7 Functional Requirements

| Requirement ID | Description |

|---|---|

| FR-1 | The workflow shall support manual triggering from the main branch. |

| FR-2 | The workflow shall use a GitHub-hosted Ubuntu runner. |

| FR-3 | The workflow shall display the event and branch that triggered the job. |

| FR-4 | The workflow shall check out the repository code. |

| FR-5 | The workflow shall list repository contents recursively using PowerShell and save to an artifact. |

| FR-6 | The workflow shall list repository contents using a Python script and save to an artifact. |

| FR-7 | The workflow shall upload the results as build artifacts. |

| FR-8 | The workflow shall include a job to retrieve and display workflow metadata. |

| FR-9 | The workflow shall create a downloads folder if it does not exist. |

| FR-10 | The workflow shall download and display the artifact contents. |

1.8 Non-Functional Requirements

**Portability:** Must run on GitHub-hosted Ubuntu runners.

**Usability:** Steps and outputs must be clear and easy to follow.

**Auditability:** All artifacts and metadata must be accessible after workflow completion.

**Extensibility:** The workflow should be easy to extend for additional scripting or artifact types.

1.9 Assumptions and Dependencies

The repository uses GitHub Actions and/or Azure DevOps pipelines.

PowerShell and Python are available on the runner.

Users have permission to trigger workflows and access artifacts.

1.10 Success Criteria / KPIs

All workflow steps complete successfully without errors.

Artifacts are uploaded, downloaded, and displayed as expected.

Workflow metadata is reported and accessible.

1.11 Milestones & Timeline

Workflow YAML and scripts implemented: Complete

Artifact upload/download tested: Complete

Documentation and PRD: Complete

1.12 Usage Instructions (Demonstration Sequence)

1.12.1 Pre-requisites

Create two github environments named `dev` and `prd`.

Configure the 'prd' environment for manual approval with the following settings:

**Required reviewers:** 1

**Wait timer:** 0 minutes

**Deployment branches:** main

**Deployment protection rules:** None

Create a new Azure app registration with the name of ghc-scenario-id-39 and retrieve the following details:

## Client ID# Tenant ID# Client Secret

Workflow Steps

Trigger the workflow manually from the main branch using the workflow_dispatch event.

The workflow runs on an Ubuntu GitHub-hosted runner.

The workflow displays the event and branch name.

The repository is checked out.

A PowerShell script lists all repository contents and saves the output to the artifacts folder.

A Python script (getDirectoryContents.py) in the .github/workflows/src folder lists repository contents and saves the output.

Both outputs are uploaded as build artifacts.

A new job retrieves workflow metadata (branch, job ID) and displays it.

The workflow creates a downloads folder if needed.

The workflow downloads the previously uploaded artifact and displays its contents using PowerShell.

1.13 Key Takeaways

The workflow automates repository content listing, artifact management, and metadata reporting.

Both PowerShell and Python are used for cross-platform compatibility.

The solution is extensible and demonstrates best practices in CI/CD automation.

Terminal Command Best Practices

If you are generating terminal commands, follow these best practices to ensure clarity, security, and maintainability:

Terminal host

**Shell Selection:** Use PowerShell for Windows environments and Bash for Unix-based systems unless otherwise specified.

**Detect Environment:** Use environment detection to choose the appropriate shell dynamically when writing cross-platform scripts.

**Consistent Usage:** To avoid environment compatibility issues, consistently use the same shell throughout a script or project.

**Example**:*

```powershell

cd ".\src\workspace\calculator-xunit-testing\python" ; python -m pytest tests/test_calculator.py -v --tb=short 2>&1 | head -50

head: The term 'head' is not recognized as a name of a cmdlet, function, script file, or executable program.

Check the spelling of the name, or if a path was included, verify that the path is correct and try again.

```text

In this case, the `head` command is not recognized in PowerShell. Instead, use `Select-Object -First 50` to achieve similar functionality:

```powershell

cd ".\src\workspace\calculator-xunit-testing\python" ; python -m pytest tests/test_calculator.py -v --tb=short 2>&1 | Select-Object -First 50

```text

**Diagrams** Use either ASCII art or markdown mermaid syntax for diagrams and flowcharts.
